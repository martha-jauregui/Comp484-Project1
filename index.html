            <h2>What is Folklórico?</h2>
            <img src="images/folklorico dancers.png" alt="Dancers" width="400" class="flowRight">
             <p> Folklórico is a vibrant traditional dance style originating from México that fuses indigenous, Spanish, and local customs to represent diverse regional cultures. These performances are famously accompanied by live Mariachi music, creating a powerful synergy between the rhythmic footwork and the soaring trumpets and violins. With over 30 distinct regional styles, the dance serves as a living history book of the unique heritage found across different Mexican states. The artistic choreography is designed to convey cultural stories through highly expressive movements and theatrical flair. To enhance the sound, the dancers wear specialized shoes with nails in the heels and toes that allow them to act as percussion instruments alongside the music.</p>
             <h2> Overview</h2>
             <p> Folklórico has a variety of different regions, ranging from the North, South, Central East and West states of Mexico. Each state has its own music, wardrobe, and dance that differs from the others. Some characteristics may include, colors, types of shoes, accessories, presentation, and behavior. <style></style></p>
