Dancers are known for their heavy, colorful ribbon dresses and the men's traditional Charro suits. Performed with live Marachi, a very lively and energentic dance.

      <dt><h3>Veracruz</h3> <dt>
       <dd><p>Characterized by a mix of African, Spanish, and indigenous rhythms, featuring instruments like the harp, Veracruz is much more elegant. The music is often <em>Son Jarocho</em>, featuring harps and guitars allowing for a variety of songs ranging from energentic to more sensual. In contrast to Jalisco, Veracruz dances feature elegant, all-white lace costumes. Tradtional songs include La Bamba, an iconic wedding song that include the dancers typing a bow with their feet, as a symbol of their love for each other. </p> </dd>

    <section id="chihuahua">
       <dt> <h3>Chihuahua</h3> </dt>
       <dd><p>Originating from the Northern border regions, the dances of Chihuahua are heavily influenced by European polkas and waltzes brought over in the 19th century. The music is characterized by the lively sounds of the accordion, saxophone, and double bass, creating a high-energy rhythm that is distinctly different from the Mariachi of the South. Chihuahua costumes reflect the ruggedness of Northern ranch life. Women wear high-collared, puff-sleeved blouses and full circular skirts made of heavy fabric, while men wear cowboy-style "Norteño" attire, including boots, vests, and wide-brimmed hats. The choreography involves sharp, rhythmic stomping and rapid turns that mimic the celebratory spirit of Northern festivals.</p>
